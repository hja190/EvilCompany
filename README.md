# EvilCompany

## FAQ
### How do I install this?
Either use the Thunderstore mod manager or place the dll in the BepInEx/plugins folder.

### Does everyone need this mod?
Yes... I'm currently working on making a host only version of this mod but for now all players need this mod for it to work.

### But I want to mess with my friends without them knowning...
Either:
- If you have coding and modding knowledge you can take the code here and make it yourself
- Wait until I make a host only version of this mod

### I keep craching
This is my first ever BepInEx mod so that's to be expected. All I can say is to not spam any of the keys.

### Current Issues
Evil points don't save after you leave the server, it gets reset to the host's starting evil points value.
